Description: A tool for biomarker identification by integrating omics
    assays with pathway information. Based on a two-step model
    <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.01.502395v1>,
    ioSearch explores the inter-relationship of the omics to provide
    easily interpretable inferences in terms of p-values. Also, it uses
    prior biological (eg. pathway) information to reduce multiple testing
    burdens. It explores jointly the omics that are known to be
    functionally related. Its use on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) multi-omics datasets is quite
    straightforward.
